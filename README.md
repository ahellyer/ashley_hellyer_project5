A project built in React that pulls data from the New York Times Books API to display six different bestsellers lists: Fiction, Nonfiction, Advice, Business, Young Adult and Science. A secondary call is made to the Google Books API to fetch each books cover image, an extended discription and links to a google books preview if available. Linked to firebase, users can add and remove books from a favourites list.
